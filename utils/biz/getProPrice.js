FEATURES
1. timeDevGrade also Difficulty to build
2. Comsumption of resource (database request, database space, server)
3. Active Client's Base group - (default 30)

LABEL
the yearly and monthly brazilian real values.

FORMULA:
P = Highest Price with no discount (Meu Bronze)
Dev = Time or Difficulty to develop the service (10 - 20).
Res = Comsumption of Resource (10 - 20).
Val = Value per weight R$ 100
Cli = Active Client's Base group
Dis = Fixed Discount between plans for each service. (R$ 10)
Meu Bronze = R$ 0 discount
Prata = R$ 10 discount
Gold = R$ 20 discount

P = (Dev x Val) + (Res x Val) / Cli
P = P - Dis

NOTES:
1. If the client decide to pay per month, there will be 10% more comparing to yearly period since a year has 12 monthes.
2. Minimum value is R$ 5 with maximum discount and maximum value is R$ 135 per service.
3. The price for each customer is regulated on the market.
4. Weight five is the default minimum weight because we can discount up until 3 times between the plan before the value gets negative due to substraction like the sequence: R$ 15, R$ 5, R$ -5
5. The most complete plan (gold plan) reach its maximum price based on the market highest plan based (R$ 1.490) with alike number of features
6. Competition Benchmarking is used for:
a) Regulate the maximum price for the most complete plan;
b) Get the value paid by customer based on the total of the most complete plan divided by the number of customer's registration.
7. Two possible unit values for simplicity:
For yearly Period:
if the unit's value is below or equal to 5, then 5. Otherwise goes to the next decimal
56, 57, 57.33 goes to 60.

For monthly Period:
it is always 10% from the yearly value.
exemple:
R$ 150 yearly, R$ 15 montly
R$ 135 yearly, R$ 13.5 montly

Then, the client will pay 20% more comparing to yearly period if paid monthly during a year.
8. Minimum purchase value to compensate taxes is R$ 28.
