LEading and trailing egdes
One gotcha here is if you specify leading and trailing set to false, the callback does not fire. Setting the leading to true will begin callback execution immediately and then throttle. When you set both leading and trailing to true, this guarantees execution per interval.

/**
 * Creates a throttled function that only invokes `func` at most once per
 * every `wait` milliseconds. The throttled function comes with a `cancel`
 * method to cancel delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to
 * immediately invoke them. Provide an options object to indicate whether
 * `func` should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`
 * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the
 * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the
 * result of the last `func` invocation.
 *
 * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is
 * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function
 * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.
 *

Use case
To make Ajax requests, or deciding if adding/removing a class (that could trigger a CSS animation), I would consider _.debounce or _.throttle, where you can set up lower executing rates (200ms for example, instead of 16ms)

infinite scrolling:
A quite common example. The user is scrolling down your infinite-scrolling page. You need to check how far from the bottom the user is. If the user is near the bottom, we should request via Ajax more content and append it to the page.
Here our beloved _.debounce wouldn’t be helpful. It only would trigger only when the user stops scrolling.
